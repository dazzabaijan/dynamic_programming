# Dynamic programming with Python
This repo contains solutions to the all interesting dynamic programming questions that I come across.

  <summary><b>1) The Fibonacci sequence</b></summary>
  Return the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are equal to 1; any other number is equal to sum of the preceding two numbers.

  <summary><b>2) Optimal stock market strategy</b></summary>
  When evaluating stock market trading strategies, it is useful to determine the maximum possible profit that can be made by trading a certain stock. Write an algorithm that,     given the daily price of a stock, computes the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling that stock. Assume that you are allowed to own no more than 1 share at any time, and that you have an unlimited budget.<br>
  <br>
  Example 1: The stock price over several days is [2, 5, 1]. The best strategy is to buy a share on the first day for price 2, then sell it on the second day for price 5, obtaining a profit of 3.<br>
  <br>
  Example 2: The stock price over several days is [2, 5, 1, 3]. The best strategy is to buy a share on the first day for price 2, then sell it on the second day for price 5, obtaining a profit of 3; then buy it again on the third day for price 1, and sell it on the fourth day for price 3, obtaining an overall profit of 5.

  <summary><b>3) Integer Break</b></summary>
  Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximise the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.<br>
  Constraints:
    2 <= n <= 58
  <br>
  <b>Example 1:</b><br>
    Input: n = 2<br>
  Output: 1<br>
  Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 * 1 = 1.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Example 2:</b><br>
  Input: n = 10<br>
  Output: 36<br>
  Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 * 3 * 4 = 36.
