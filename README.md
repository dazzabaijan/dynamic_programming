  <summary><b>2) Optimal stock market strategy</b></summary>
  When evaluating stock market trading strategies, it is useful to determine the maximum possible profit that can be made by trading a certain stock. Write an algorithm that,     given the daily price of a stock, computes the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling that stock. Assume that you are allowed to own no more than 1 share at any time, and that you have an unlimited budget.<br>
  
Example 1: The stock price over several days is [2, 5, 1]. The best strategy is to buy a share on the first day for price 2, then sell it on the second day for price 5, obtaining a profit of 3.<br>
  
  Example 2: The stock price over several days is [2, 5, 1, 3]. The best strategy is to buy a share on the first day for price 2, then sell it on the second day for price 5, obtaining a profit of 3; then buy it again on the third day for price 1, and sell it on the fourth day for price 3, obtaining an overall profit of 5.
